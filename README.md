# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project was to determine if vine reviews caused a product to sell better or if the sales were indifferent to that status.  Pyspark within Google Colab was utilized to help perform an ETL process on the dataset.  The data came from an Amazon web service and was extracted into datframes for transformation.
